These files are for the casual Windows programmer that does not 
have C/C++ background knowlege, and wants to make Go their first
language, like me!  The devs of Go have provided numerous excellent
tutorials, but I found they all started at chapter 2, missing out
the steps for the absolute ... beginner.

I highly recommend you use this IDE

... because I do.
